Introduction
============



This is the collective.guestbookcomments package for Plone.

Guestbook-style comments are an extension to the Plone commenting system
to display comments for a designated content object guestbook-style.
 

That means:

- core functionality of plone.app.discussion is untouched, although some
  subclassing was necessary to implement reordering of comments and to decide
  actually how to display. (comment-style/guestbook-style)
- standard plone comments are used as guestbook entries.
- uses own browser layer, and is not a theming addon. Styling the guestbook
  is up to the site designer/maintainer.
- separate guestbook add form and commenting page templates for easy theme styling.
- extended "Thank you for your guestbook entry!" notice with view!
- guestbook-style display of comments is enabled/disabled per object in content object 
  properties tab. (via archetypes.schemaextender)
- newest guestbook entry appears on top!
- replies appear always below a guestbook entry.
- user editable guestbook entry title. For a comment this is usually autogenerated by Plone.
