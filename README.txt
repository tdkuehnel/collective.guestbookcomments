Introduction
============



This is the collective.guestbookcomments package for Plone.

Every Plone content which can have discussions enabled, like Documents or Images,
can be used as a guestbook for your site. 

A guestbook extends the builtin Plone commenting system:

- seperate set of page-templates and add form for theme-styling the guestbook.
- Newest entries appear on top.
- Replies to entries appear below an entry.
- Seperate "Thank you for you guestbook entry" view for better feedback to guestbook visitors leaving a comment.
- guestbook style can be switched on and off per content object.
- Should not interfere with discussion system. That means, turning guestbook style comments of for an content object,
  they appear as usual comments, and vice versa.
- User editable guestbook entry title. For a comment this is usually autogenerated by Plone.

Installation is straightforward, just add an collective.guestbookcomments entry to the eggs section in your buildout.cfg

Requirements:
	archetypes.schemaextender
	Plone 4
